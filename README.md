I spend most of my time learning the ins and outs of frontend web development which means I'm doing a lot of javascript programming. I got started with jquery but gradually moved to React and Vue (and just plain old JS when the situation calls for it).

The end game for me is to get good at creating data-driven user interfaces which means I know a thing or two about hooking things up to a backend whether that be through serverless functions or api calls. We're all just hitting endpoints and retrieving data at the end of the day.
